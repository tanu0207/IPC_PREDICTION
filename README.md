# IPC_PREDICTION
This project aims to develop an innovative system for predicting the applicable Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections based on victim statements, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), Python, and Generative AI techniques. The core functionality of the system lies in the application of NLP on victim statements to identify and extract relevant information, subsequently matching it with IPC sections from a comprehensive dataset. To enhance the semantic understanding of statements, both Word2Vec and the Universal Sentence Encoder are employed for vectorization. Word2Vec captures word similarities and relationships, while the Universal Sentence Encoder encodes entire sentences, providing a comprehensive representation for improved matching accuracy. The integration of Generative AI further refines the prediction process, allowing the system to learn and adapt based on the evolving dataset. This project aims to streamline and automate the process of identifying IPC sections, facilitating more efficient and accurate legal procedures based on victim statements. Contributors are encouraged to explore, enhance, and customize the system to address real-world legal challenges effectively.
